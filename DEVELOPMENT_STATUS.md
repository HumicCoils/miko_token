- **JupiterAdapter**: Full Jupiter v6 integration for Token-2022 swaps
- **MockBirdeyeAdapter**: Clearly labeled mock for local fork testing
- **DistributionEngine**: Rollover mechanism for early launch phase
- **Keeper Top-up**: Automatically uses up to 20% of tax when keeper < 0.05 SOL

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Run swap test to generate fees** (PRIORITY)
   - Execute swap-test.ts with 20 wallets
   - Generate 500k+ MIKO in tax fees
   - Verify fees accumulate in withheld accounts
   ```bash
   cd scripts/phase4b
   npx tsx swap-test.ts
   ```

2. **Test harvest → swap → distribute cycle**
   - Run keeper bot to detect threshold
   - Execute 3-step harvest flow
   - Test tax flow scenarios with keeper top-up
   - Verify distribution or rollover
   ```bash
   cd scripts/phase4b/phase4b-keeper
   npx tsx keeper-bot-phase4b.ts
   ```

3. **Integration testing scenarios**
   - Test with keeper balance < 0.05 SOL
   - Test with no eligible holders (rollover)
   - Test with different reward tokens
   - Test batch distribution

4. **Generate VC:4.LOCAL_FORK_PASS**
   - Document all test results
   - Verify all keeper operations work
   - Create verification report

5. **Fix launch coordinator** (after keeper bot testing)
   - Address 2-minute timeout limitation
   - Create fresh token for complete launch test

## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. No Transfer Hook
- Decision: Use only TransferFeeConfig extension
- Reason: Transfer hooks break wallet/DEX compatibility
- Result: Token works with all standard infrastructure

### 2. Tax Flow Design
- 3-step process: Harvest → Withdraw from Mint → Distribute
- All fees flow through Token-2022 withheld accounts
- Distribution Engine V2 handles undistributed funds

### 3. CPMM for Token-2022
- Decision: Use CPMM instead of CLMM
- Reason: CLMM doesn't support Token-2022 tokens
- Solution: Pre-create WSOL ATA before pool creation

### 4. No Treasury
- Treasury concept removed from all programs
- Tax distribution: 20% to owner, 80% to holders
- Simplifies architecture and reduces complexity

### 5. Production Configuration System
- Decision: Use ConfigManager with auto-derived values
- Minimal config contains only: RPC URL, program IDs, token mint, keeper path
- All PDAs and pool info derived from chain
- Result: No manual JSON editing during deployment flow

## Phase 4-B Configuration
| Wallet Type | Public Key | Purpose |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| Deployer | `CDTSFkBB1TuRw7WFZj4ZQpagwBhw5iURjC13kS6hEgSc` | Deployment and initial operations |
| Owner | `D24rokM1eAxWAU9MQYuXK9QK4jnT1qJ23VP4dCqaw5uh` | Receives 20% of tax |
| Keeper | `6LTnRkPHh27xTgpfkzibe7XcUSGe3kVazvweei1D3syn` | Bot operations |

## Key Files for Continuation
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `minimal-config.json` | Essential configuration (RPC, programs, token mint) |
| `phase4b-keeper/keeper-bot-phase4b.ts` | Main keeper bot entry point |
| `swap-test.ts` | Generate tax fees for testing |
| `phase4b-keeper/rollover-state.json` | Tracks undistributed rewards (created on first run) |
| `phase4b-init-info.json` | Contains vault initialization details |
| `launch-execution.log` | Pool creation details |

## Launch Parameters
- **Pool Type**: Raydium CPMM (Token-2022 compatible)
- **Liquidity**: 90% supply (900M MIKO) + 10 SOL
- **Stages**: Bootstrap → A → B → C (over 5 minutes)
- **Fee Schedule**: 30% → 15% (5min) → 5% (10min)
- **Oracle**: Pyth SOL/USD price feed required

## Phase 4-B Test Results
- **Test Pool Created**: `BJshJ58WUTC9bKar7QidUJM278rrMrmqSgj4SbKve44`
- **LP Mint**: `AK9F3w4yA6c2PbmN4GP6XBBJc6ZENmvVYko48zdQmmxg`
- **Issue**: Decimal calculation error (0.045 MIKO instead of 45M)
- **Liquidity Removal**: Successfully tested and removed all liquidity

## Important Reminders
- ⚠️ NEVER change program keypairs after generation
- ⚠️ Always verify declare_id! matches deployed program
- ⚠️ Test everything on fork before mainnet
- ⚠️ WSOL ATA must be created before CPMM pool creation
- ⚠️ All verification contracts must PASS before proceeding

## Critical Lessons Learned (Mistakes to Avoid)

### 1. IDL File Management
**Mistake**: Deleted `target/` directory thinking IDL files were regeneratable  
**Impact**: Nearly blocked Phase 3 progress - Anchor requires IDL for client interactions  
**Lesson**: IDL files are CRITICAL deployment artifacts that must be preserved  
**Prevention**: Copy IDL files to shared-artifacts immediately after generation

### 2. Program ID Handling
**Mistake**: Running `anchor build` changed all program IDs in source files  
**Impact**: Could have broken entire deployment if not caught  
**Lesson**: Build process modifies declare_id! statements  
**Prevention**: Always backup source files before rebuilds

### 3. declare_id! Mismatch (CATASTROPHIC)
**Mistake**: Source code declare_id! didn't match deployed program IDs  
**Impact**: FORCED REDEPLOYMENT - Would lose ALL FUNDS on mainnet  
**What Happened**:
- Deployed programs had different IDs than source code
- Result: DeclaredProgramIdMismatch error → forced to redeploy
**Why This Is CATASTROPHIC**:
- Redeploying resets ALL program state
- All user funds would be LOST
- All authorities would be RESET
- Token authorities would be BROKEN forever
**Prevention Protocol**:
1. ALWAYS verify declare_id! matches deployed program BEFORE operations
2. NEVER modify declare_id! after deployment
3. Create pre-flight check script:
```bash
solana program show <deployed-id> | grep "Program Id"
grep "declare_id!" src/lib.rs
# These MUST match EXACTLY
```

### 4. Transfer Hook Incompatibility
**Mistake**: Initially included transfer hook extension  
**Impact**: Token unusable with all wallets and DEXs  
**Root Cause**: Transfer hooks require extra accounts that wallets don't provide  
**Solution**: Removed transfer hook, use only TransferFeeConfig  
**Lesson**: Standard compatibility > advanced features

### 5. Tax Flow Design Flaw
**Mistake**: harvest_fees sent fees to mint, distribute_rewards tried to use vault account  
**Impact**: Entire tax system non-functional  
**Solution**: Added withdraw_fees_from_mint step (3-step flow)  
**Lesson**: Always trace fund flow completely before implementation

### 6. Anchor Program Constructor Changes
**Mistake**: Used old Anchor syntax with programId parameter  
**Impact**: DeclaredProgramIdMismatch error preventing initialization  
**Solution**: Override IDL address field instead:
```typescript
// WRONG (old syntax):
const program = new Program(idl, programId, provider);

// CORRECT (v0.30.0+):
idl.address = actualDeployedProgramId;
const program = new Program(idl, provider);
```

### 7. CPMM vs CLMM Requirements
**Mistake**: Assumed CPMM works like CLMM for WSOL handling  
**Impact**: Pool creation fails with missing WSOL account  
**Lesson**: CPMM requires manual WSOL ATA creation, CLMM does it automatically  
**Solution**: Pre-create WSOL ATA before pool creation (documented in `cpmm_wsol_fix.md`)

### 8. Treasury Over-Engineering
**Mistake**: Initially included treasury concept in architecture  
**Impact**: Added unnecessary complexity with no actual function  
**Solution**: Removed treasury from all programs and scripts  
**Lesson**: Simpler architecture is better - avoid unused features

### 9. Program Deployment Order and ID Management
**Mistake**: Deployed programs without ensuring declare_id! matched the deployment keypair  
**Impact**: DeclaredProgramIdMismatch error preventing program initialization  
**Root Cause**: Used different keypairs for deployment than what was in source code  
**What Happened**:
- Phase 4-B programs had declare_id! with old addresses from previous phase
- Deployed with new keypairs but source still referenced old IDs
- Result: Program ID in deployed binary didn't match runtime expectation
**Solution**: Complete fresh deployment:
1. Generate NEW program keypairs
2. Update declare_id! in source with the new keypair addresses
3. Rebuild programs (anchor build)
4. Deploy with the SAME keypairs used in declare_id!
**Lesson**: Program ID must be consistent across three places:
- Keypair used for deployment
- declare_id! in source code
- Deployed program on chain
**Prevention**: Always verify before deployment:
```bash
solana-keygen pubkey phase4b-vault-keypair.json  # Should match...
grep "declare_id!" programs/absolute-vault/src/lib.rs  # ...this address
```

### 10. Critical Decimal Calculation Error
**Mistake**: Forgot to multiply MIKO amounts by 1e9 when creating CPMM pool
**Impact**: Only 0.045 MIKO deposited instead of 45,000,000 MIKO
**What Happened**:
- MIKO has 9 decimals like SOL
- Passed raw amounts without converting to smallest units
- Result: 45000000 became 0.045 MIKO
**Lesson**: ALWAYS convert token amounts to smallest units:
```typescript
// WRONG:
mintBAmount: new BN(bootstrap.mikoAmount)  // 45000000 = 0.045 MIKO

// CORRECT:
mintBAmount: new BN(bootstrap.mikoAmount * 1e9)  // 45000000 * 1e9 = 45M MIKO
```
**Prevention**: Create helper functions for token amount conversions

### 11. CPMM Liquidity Removal Success
**Achievement**: Successfully removed liquidity from Raydium CPMM pool
**Method**: Used Raydium SDK v2 withdrawLiquidity function
**Key Steps**:
1. Initialize Raydium SDK with deployer keypair
2. Get pool info using getPoolInfoFromRpc
3. Find LP token balance in deployer's ATA
4. Call withdrawLiquidity with full LP amount
**Important**: This capability is critical for mainnet emergency situations
**Script Location**: `/scripts/phase4b/debug/remove-cpmm-liquidity.ts`

### 12. Phase 4-B Directory Isolation
**Mistake**: Tried to modify files in `/programs/` directory during Phase 4-B
**Impact**: Confusion between Phase 4-B isolated programs and root programs
**What Happened**:
- Phase 4-B has its own copy of programs in `/scripts/phase4b/phase4b-programs/`
- Tried to edit `declare_id!` in root `/programs/` directory
- Root `/programs/` are from Phase 1-3 and should NOT be touched during Phase 4-B
**Lesson**: During Phase 4-B, ONLY work with files in `/scripts/phase4b/` directory
**Prevention**: 
- Phase 4-B programs: `/scripts/phase4b/phase4b-programs/programs/`
- Phase 4-B scripts: `/scripts/phase4b/`
- NEVER touch root `/programs/` during Phase 4-B unless referencing past work

### 13. Missing Fee Update Implementation
**Mistake**: Assumed fee updates would happen automatically
**Impact**: Fees stuck at 30% instead of transitioning to 15% → 5%
**What Happened**:
- Vault program has `update_transfer_fee` function that validates time-based fees
- Launch coordinator only monitors fee transition times but doesn't call update
- Keeper bot has no fee update logic implemented
- Result: Fees never change from initial 30%
**Root Cause**: PLAN.md specified "Fee Update Manager" but it was never implemented
**Lesson**: Always verify critical features are actually implemented, not just designed
**Fix Required**:
- Keeper bot needs to call `update_transfer_fee` at 5 and 10 minutes
- Must pass correct fee for time period (1500 at 5min, 500 at 10min)
- After 10 minutes, fee is finalized and locked permanently

### 14. Keeper Bot Mock-Only Implementation
**Discovery**: Phase 4-B testing revealed keeper bot cannot execute any on-chain operations
**Impact**: All automated functionality non-functional - fees, harvests, swaps, distributions
**What Happened**:
- Phase 4-A built keeper bot with mock adapters for CI testing
- All real implementations left as TODOs with "Real X not implemented in mock phase" errors
- Phase 4-B wrapper tried to use Phase 4-A bot but constructor incompatible
- Result: Keeper bot knows WHEN to act but cannot actually DO anything on-chain
**Root Cause**: Phase isolation principle taken too literally - no real implementations created
**Lesson**: Mock testing is valuable but real implementations must follow immediately
**Fix Required**: Implement all 8 keeper bot functions for actual on-chain operations

### 15. Keeper Bot Fee Update Implementation Success
**Achievement**: Successfully implemented automated fee updates in Phase 4-B keeper bot
**What Happened**:
- Created standalone keeper bot in `/scripts/phase4b/phase4b-keeper/`
- Ported all necessary modules from root keeper bot
- Implemented real vault program calls for fee updates
- Used blockchain time (not system time) for accurate transitions
- Successfully updated fee from 30% to 5% after 10+ minutes elapsed
**Key Implementation Details**:
- Created FeeUpdateImpl class to handle actual on-chain transactions
- Enhanced FeeUpdateManagerPhase4B to check actual mint fee state
- Parsed Token-2022 mint extensions to read current fee
- Keeper bot runs checks every 30 seconds
**Lesson**: Always use blockchain time for time-based logic, not system time

### 16. Manual Configuration System Issues
**Mistake**: Built test-level config system requiring manual JSON updates throughout deployment
**Impact**: Production deployment would require hand-editing config files after each step
**What Happened**:
- Initial implementation used phase4b-config.json with hardcoded values
- Required manual updates after: token creation, pool creation, PDA calculation
- Extremely error-prone and unprofessional for production use
**Solution**: Created ConfigManager system:
- `minimal-config.json` contains only essential non-derivable values
- `config-manager.ts` auto-derives PDAs from program IDs and seeds
- Pool info queried from chain when needed
- Token creation script updates minimal config automatically
**Key Components**:
- **Minimal Config**: RPC URL, program IDs, token mint, keeper path
- **Auto-Derived**: Vault PDA, Smart Dial PDA, pool ID, owner/keeper wallets
- **Dynamic Queries**: Pool state, vault state, accumulated fees
**Result**: Production-ready configuration that minimizes manual intervention
**Lesson**: Always design for production deployment flow, not just testing convenience

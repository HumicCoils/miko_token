## Technical Details

### Environment
- **Solana CLI**: 2.1.20 (compatible with Anchor 0.31.1)
- **Anchor Framework**: 0.31.1
- **Rust**: Latest stable
- **Docker**: 28.3.0
- **Docker Compose**: 2.38.2

### Architecture Decisions
1. Using Solana CLI 2.1.20 for Anchor 0.31.1 compatibility
2. Docker isolation for each development phase
3. Shared artifacts volume for program ID persistence
4. Keypair generation before coding to ensure ID consistency

## Issues & Resolutions

### Resolved
1. **Anchor Installation**: Initial build failed with time crate compatibility issue
   - **Solution**: Updated to Anchor 0.31.1 which has the fix
   
2. **Solana Installation URL**: Changed from release.solana.com to release.anza.xyz
   - **Solution**: Updated Dockerfile with correct URL

### Current
- **Smart Dial Deployment**: Successfully deployed on 2025-07-16 after receiving 5 SOL from user
  - Status: Completed ‚úÖ

## Verification Contract Status

### Overview
Machine-checkable verification gates that must PASS before phase progression. All verifications output JSON artifacts to `shared-artifacts/verification/`.

### Phase 1 Verifications
- ‚úÖ **Program ID Match**: All deployed IDs match declared IDs (manually verified)

### Phase 2 Verifications
| VC ID | Description | Status | Artifact |
|-------|-------------|--------|----------|
| VC:2.NO_UNSUPPORTED_EXT | Verify only TransferFeeConfig extension present | ‚úÖ PASSED | vc2-no-unsupported-ext.json |
| VC:2.FEE_RATE | Transfer fee is exactly 30% | ‚úÖ PASSED | vc2-fee-rate.json |
| VC:2.AUTHORITIES | All authorities correctly set | ‚úÖ PASSED | vc2-authorities.json |

### Phase 3 Verifications
| VC ID | Description | Status | Artifact |
|-------|-------------|--------|----------|

|-------|-------------|--------|----------|
| VC:LAUNCH_TIMING | Fee transitions at exact times | ‚è≥ Not started | - |
| VC:ELIGIBILITY_SAMPLE | $100 holder filtering correct | ‚è≥ Not started | - |

## Critical Reminders
- ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER change program keypairs after generation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Always verify deployed ID matches declared ID
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Initialize programs BEFORE transferring authorities
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Mint total supply BEFORE revoking mint authority
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Follow exact order in TO_DO.md checklist
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ALL verification gates must PASS before proceeding to next phase

## CRITICAL DEPLOYER KEYPAIR INFORMATION
**NEVER CREATE A NEW DEPLOYER KEYPAIR - USE THE EXISTING ONE**
- **Deployer Address**: `AnCL6TWEGYo3zVhrXckfFiAqdQpo158JUCWPFQJEpS95`
- **Location**: Must be shared across all phase containers
- **Used In**: All phases from Phase 1 onwards
- **Authority Over**: All programs, token mint, all authorities
- **CRITICAL**: This same keypair MUST be used for ALL operations across ALL phases

## SOL Consumption

### Devnet
| Phase | Operation | SOL Used | Date |
|-------|-----------|----------|------|
| Phase 1 | Program deployments (3 programs) | ~3.0 SOL | 2025-07-15 |
| Phase 2 | Token creation with metadata | ~0.1 SOL | 2025-07-19 |
| Phase 3 | System initialization | ~0.2 SOL | 2025-07-19 |
| Phase 4-A | Mock testing (container only) | 0 SOL | 2025-07-21 |
| Phase 4-B | Local mainnet fork setup | 0 SOL | 2025-07-21 |
| **Total** | **All operations** | **~3.3 SOL** | - |

### Mainnet
| Phase | Operation | SOL Used | Date |
|-------|-----------|----------|------|
| - | Not deployed yet | 0 SOL | - |

*Note: Phase 4-A and 4-B use mock adapters and local fork, no actual blockchain interaction*

## CRITICAL ISSUE: Phase 4-B Has Mock Implementations

**Date Discovered**: 2025-07-21
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Blocks all testing
**Status**: NOT RESOLVED

### Problem
The launch coordinator (`scripts/phase4b/launch-coordinator-final.ts`) contains only mock implementations:
- Pool creation just generates a random public key instead of creating real Raydium pool
- Oracle integration returns hardcoded $190 instead of fetching real price
- Token balance checks are marked TODO
- Liquidity additions are simulated with setTimeout instead of real transactions
- Vault program calls are just console.log statements
- No actual keeper bot is spawned

### Impact
- Phase 4-B testing is MEANINGLESS with these mocks
- Cannot verify real functionality will work in production
- Violates core development principle: production-ready code only

### Required Actions
1. Implement real Raydium CLMM SDK integration
2. Implement real oracle price feeds (Pyth or Switchboard)
3. Implement actual SPL token balance queries
4. Implement real program instruction calls
5. Implement actual keeper bot process management

**DO NOT PROCEED** with Phase 4-B testing until these are implemented with real functionality.

## Critical Architecture Improvements

### Undistributed Funds Handling (Added 2025-07-21)
**Problem**: During early launch with 30% tax, no holders may meet $100 threshold, causing 80% of harvested fees to get stuck in keeper wallet.

**Solution**: Distribution Engine V2 with:
- Automatic rollover to next cycle when eligible holders appear
- Persistent state tracking (amount, token, timestamp)
- Emergency withdrawal function for authority
- Example: Cycle 1 (no holders) ‚Üí 400k MIKO saved ‚Üí Cycle 2 (holders exist) ‚Üí 800k MIKO distributed

This ensures fair distribution and prevents permanent loss of holder rewards during the critical early launch phase.

## Lessons Learned

### Critical Mistakes Made During Development

#### 1. IDL File Deletion Catastrophe (Phase 3 Blocker)
**Mistake**: Deleted `target/` directory after Phase 1 deployment thinking IDL files were "regeneratable"
**Impact**: Nearly blocked all Phase 3 progress as Anchor requires IDL for client interactions
**Lesson**: IDL files are CRITICAL deployment artifacts that must be preserved. They are NOT just build artifacts.
**Solution Applied**: Had to rebuild programs (risking ID changes), extract IDL files, then restore original program IDs

#### 2. Program ID Modification During Rebuild
**Mistake**: Running `anchor build` changed all program IDs in source files
**Impact**: Could have broken entire deployment if not caught and reverted
**Lesson**: Always backup source files before rebuilds. Build process modifies declare_id! statements.
**Solution Applied**: Manually restored original IDs in all .rs files and Anchor.toml

#### 3. IDL Structure Misunderstanding
**Mistake**: Attempted to manually construct IDL without understanding proper structure
**Impact**: Wasted significant time with incorrect IDL formats (accounts vs types, missing metadata)
**Lesson**: Anchor IDL has specific required structure - use generated IDL as reference
**Key Learning**: 
- Account types marked with #[account] go in "accounts" section, not "types"
- Discriminators are auto-calculated from instruction names
- Metadata section with address field is required

#### 4. Assuming Simplified Solutions
**Mistake**: Tried to bypass IDL by using raw instructions when blocked
**Impact**: Would have violated project requirements for production-ready code
**Lesson**: Never compromise on full functionality. If blocked, find the proper solution.

#### 5. Not Verifying Cleanup Impact
**Mistake**: Cleaned up "build artifacts" without verifying what was essential for future phases
**Impact**: Lost critical files needed for Phase 3
**Lesson**: Before any cleanup, verify files are truly regeneratable and not needed for subsequent phases

### Best Practices Established
1. **Phase Isolation**: Each phase's artifacts must be carefully preserved
2. **IDL Management**: IDL files should be copied to shared-artifacts immediately after generation
3. **Program IDs**: Must be protected and verified after any build operation
4. **Verification First**: Always run verification contracts before proceeding
5. **Documentation**: Update status files immediately after each major step

### Tool-Specific Learnings
- Anchor 0.31.1 with Solana 2.1.20 compatibility confirmed
- Program.account property requires proper IDL with accounts section
- Build process can modify source files - always verify after builds
- Docker isolation helps but shared-artifacts management is critical

### Critical Architectural Issues

#### 6. Transfer Hook Wallet/DEX Incompatibility (Phase 3 BLOCKER)
**Discovery Date**: 2025-07-16 (During VC:3.TRANSFER_TEST)
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Makes token unusable in production
**Status**: BLOCKED - Awaiting architectural decision

**Problem Description**:
- Standard SPL token transfers fail with: "An account required by the instruction is missing"
- Transfer hooks require ExtraAccountMetaList accounts that wallets don't automatically include
- Token becomes untransferable through normal channels

**Affected Platforms** (Confirmed Incompatible):
- Phantom wallet - Cannot transfer MIKO tokens
- Solflare wallet - Cannot transfer MIKO tokens  
- Backpack wallet - Cannot transfer MIKO tokens
- Raydium DEX - Cannot trade MIKO tokens
- Orca DEX - Cannot trade MIKO tokens
- Jupiter aggregator - Cannot route MIKO tokens
- Any standard SPL token infrastructure

**Root Cause**:
1. Token-2022 transfer hooks require additional accounts in transfer instructions
2. These accounts must be fetched from ExtraAccountMetaList PDA
3. Standard wallets/DEXs use basic createTransferCheckedInstruction
4. They don't know to fetch and include the hook's extra accounts
5. Result: All transfers fail unless using specialized code

**Exact Error When Testing**:
```
Program TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb invoke [1]
Program log: Instruction: TransferChecked
Unknown program 4E8NzqDaN76o7zXjLo8hYetmiBKmAXPs6vUMFaqFfmg4
Program TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb failed: An account required by the instruction is missing
```

**Impact Analysis**:
- Users cannot transfer tokens between wallets
- Token cannot be traded on any DEX
- Token cannot be used in DeFi protocols
- Only CLI transfers work (completely unusable for real users)
- Defeats entire purpose of creating a tradeable token

**Options Under Consideration**:

**Option 1: Remove Transfer Hook Entirely**
- Pros: Token becomes fully compatible with all wallets/DEXs
- Cons: Lose 1% transaction limit anti-sniper protection
- Mitigation: 30% ‚Üí 15% ‚Üí 5% tax progression should deter snipers

**Option 2: Disable Hook Logic**
- Keep hook program deployed but modify to always return success
- No transaction limits would be enforced
- Pros: Minimal code changes, token works everywhere
- Cons: Useless program consuming resources

**Option 3: Full Restart from Phase 2**
- Return to token creation phase
- Create new token WITHOUT transfer hook extension
- Only use transfer fee extension (which IS wallet compatible)
- Pros: Clean architecture, guaranteed compatibility
- Cons: Requires starting over from Phase 2

**Recommendation**: Option 3 - Full restart without transfer hook
- Transfer fee extension (30% tax) provides sufficient anti-sniper protection
- 1% transaction limit is nice-to-have but not worth breaking compatibility
- Clean implementation better than workarounds

### Phase 2/3 Cleanup Complete (2025-07-17 08:05 UTC)
- Removed all Phase 2 and Phase 3 containers and images
- Cleaned up all Phase 2/3 scripts directories
- Removed failed token artifacts (token-info.json, phase2-verification.json, pdas.json)
- Removed all verification results from Phase 2/3
- Preserved Phase 1 programs and IDL files
- Ready to restart Phase 2 WITHOUT transfer hook extension

### Phase 1 Completion (2025-07-16 03:33 UTC)
- Successfully deployed Smart Dial program after receiving 5 SOL funding
- All three programs now deployed to devnet:
  - Absolute Vault: `4ieMsf7qFmh1W5FwcaX6M3fz3NNyaGy3FyuXoKJLrRDq`
  - Transfer Hook: `4E8NzqDaN76o7zXjLo8hYetmiBKmAXPs6vUMFaqFfmg4`
  - Smart Dial: `DggkQFbBnkMCK43y5JTHfYdX3CKw2H3m177TbLC7Mjdz`
- All declared IDs match deployed IDs ‚úÖ
- Phase 1 validation complete ‚úÖ
- Ready to proceed to Phase 2: MIKO Token Creation


### Transfer Hook Decision (2025-07-17)
- **Critical Issue Discovered**: Transfer hooks make tokens incompatible with standard wallets/DEXs
- **Decision**: Restart Phase 2 WITHOUT transfer hook extension
- **Rationale**: 30% initial fee provides sufficient anti-sniper protection
- **Status**: All Phase 2/3 artifacts cleaned up, ready to restart

## Phase 4-B: Launch Parameters Summary

### Liquidity Deployment (from LAUNCH_LIQUIDITY_PARAMS.md)
- **Total**: 90% of supply (900M MIKO) + 10 SOL
- **Bootstrap (T+0s)**: 1% (10M) + 0.2 SOL, ¬±30% range
- **Stage A (T+60s)**: 4% (40M) + 0.8 SOL, ¬±50% range
- **Stage B (T+180s)**: 15% (150M) + 3.0 SOL, -70%/+100% range
- **Stage C (T+300s)**: 70% (700M) + 6.0 SOL, near-infinite range

### Key Requirements
- Oracle price fetch REQUIRED before pool creation
- Strict timing: ¬±5 second windows
- Fee transitions: 30% ‚Üí 15% (5min) ‚Üí 5% (10min)
- Initial FDV target: ~$19,000 (at $190/SOL)

## Phase 4-B Files Created

### Launch Infrastructure (`scripts/phase4b/`)
1. **Launch Coordinator** (`launch-coordinator-final.ts`):
   - Full implementation of 4-stage liquidity ladder
   - Oracle price integration
   - Strict timing enforcement
   - Comprehensive metrics and reporting

2. **Mainnet Fork Scripts**:
   - `start-mainnet-fork.sh` - Starts local validator with cloned programs
   - `stop-mainnet-fork.sh` - Stops validator and optional cleanup
   - `mainnet-fork-config.ts` - Configuration with discovered program IDs

3. **Distribution Engine V2** (`keeper-bot/src/modules/DistributionEngineV2.ts`):
   - Rollover mechanism for undistributed funds
   - Persistent state management
   - Emergency withdrawal capability

4. **Emergency Functions** (`emergency-withdraw-undistributed.ts`):
   - Check undistributed balances
   - Authority-only withdrawal to treasury

5. **Documentation**:
   - `scripts/phase4b/README.md` - Complete usage guide
   - Updated PLAN.md with undistributed funds handling section

## Summary of Current State

**What's Complete**:
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: All three programs deployed (Vault, Hook, Smart Dial)
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: MIKO token created with 30% fee (no transfer hook)
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: System initialized, authorities transferred
- ‚úÖ Phase 4-A: Mock CI tests with all VCs passed
- ‚úÖ Phase 4-B: Setup complete, ready for test execution

**Today's Accomplishments (2025-07-21)**:
- ‚úÖ Discovered mainnet program IDs (Raydium CLMM, Jupiter V6)
- ‚úÖ Implemented Distribution Engine V2 with undistributed funds rollover
- ‚úÖ Created emergency withdrawal functions
- ‚úÖ Built comprehensive launch coordinator with LAUNCH_LIQUIDITY_PARAMS.md specs
- ‚úÖ Added undistributed funds handling documentation to PLAN.md
- ‚úÖ Created mainnet fork startup/shutdown scripts
- ‚úÖ Ready for Phase 4-B test execution

**What's Next**:
- ‚ùå **BLOCKED**: Cannot proceed with Phase 4-B testing due to mock implementations
- üîß **Required**: Replace ALL mock code with real implementations:
  1. Integrate Raydium CLMM SDK for real pool creation
  2. Integrate Pyth or Switchboard for real oracle prices
  3. Implement real SPL token balance queries  
  4. Implement real Anchor program calls to Vault/SmartDial
  5. Implement real keeper bot process spawning
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT** run tests with mock implementations - it's meaningless
- üìã Only after implementing real functionality, then test Phase 4-B

**Key Learning**: Transfer hooks are powerful but break standard wallet compatibility. For a token that needs to work everywhere, stick to standard extensions only.

## Maintenance Guidelines for Clean Structure

### Essential Files to Preserve
1. **Program Keypairs** (`programs/keypairs/`): CRITICAL - Never delete or regenerate
2. **Shared Artifacts** (`docker/shared-artifacts/`): Contains deployed program IDs and token info
3. **Lock Files** (`Cargo.lock`, `package-lock.json`): Ensures reproducible builds
4. **Source Code** (`programs/programs/*/src/`, `scripts/*.ts`): All implemented logic
5. **Configuration Files** (`Anchor.toml`, `docker-compose.yml`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.)
6. **Token Info** (`shared-artifacts/token-info.json`): CRITICAL - Contains mint keypair

### Files/Folders That Can Be Regenerated
1. `programs/target/` directory: Created by `anchor build` (~4.6GB)
2. `programs/node_modules/` directory: Created by `npm install` (~83MB)
3. `scripts/node_modules/` directory: Created by `npm install` (~66MB)
4. Build artifacts: Any `.so` files outside of deployment

### Cleanup Commands for Future Phases
```bash
# Phase 1 cleanup (inside container):
docker exec -i miko-phase1-programs bash -c "cd /workspace/programs && rm -rf target/ node_modules/"

# Phase 2 cleanup (inside container):
docker exec -i miko-phase2-token bash -c "cd /workspace/scripts && rm -rf node_modules/"

# General Docker cleanup:
docker image prune -f
docker volume prune -f
docker container prune -f
```

### Project Size Management
- Clean project size: 640KB (after Phase 2 cleanup)
- Phase 1 build artifacts: ~4.6GB (target + node_modules)
- Phase 2 build artifacts: ~66MB (node_modules)
- Always clean after successful deployments
- Document any new persistent files added

## Notes
- Phase 1 completed successfully with all programs deployed (2 programs only)
- Phase 2 restarted and completed successfully with MIKO token created (NO transfer hook)
- All Phase 2 verification contracts PASSED
- Project structure is clean and organized
- Essential artifacts preserved in shared-artifacts
- Deployer keypair (`AnCL6TWEGYo3zVhrXckfFiAqdQpo158JUCWPFQJEpS95`) saved to shared-artifacts
- Both Phase 1 and Phase 2 containers running
- Ready for Phase 3: System Initialization & Authority Transfer

## Phase 2 Artifacts Summary (NEW - Phase 2 Restart)
- **Token Mint**: `A9xZnPo2SvSgWiSxh4XApZyjyYRcH1ES8zTCvhzogYRE`
- **Mint Keypair**: Stored in token-info.json
- **Transfer Fee**: 30% (3000 basis points)
- **Extensions**: TransferFeeConfig ONLY (NO transfer hook)
- **All Authorities**: Currently with deployer `AnCL6TWEGYo3zVhrXckfFiAqdQpo158JUCWPFQJEpS95`
- **Deployer ATA**: `J8HYEx8UYJPb7HDJqLqrCpUKyhbJHCjuefUoeGmCZaFa`
- **Verification Results**: All VCs passed and stored in verification/
  - VC:2.NO_UNSUPPORTED_EXT ‚úÖ
  - VC:2.FEE_RATE ‚úÖ
  - VC:2.AUTHORITIES ‚úÖ

## CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY (2025-07-21)

**Phase 1**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - All programs deployed
**Phase 2**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Token created without transfer hook
**Phase 3**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - System initialized, authorities transferred
**Phase 4-A**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Mock CI tests passed (fixed critical bugs)
**Phase 4-B**: ‚ùå BLOCKED - Launch coordinator has mock implementations instead of real code

**Critical Blocker**: The launch coordinator script contains only simulated/mock operations:
- Generates random addresses instead of creating real pools
- Uses hardcoded prices instead of real oracles
- Uses setTimeout instead of real transactions
- Console.log instead of real program calls

**This violates the core development principle**: We need production-ready code that will work when deployed to mainnet, not mock implementations that just pass tests.

**Next Action Required**: Implement REAL functionality before any testing can proceed.

## Phase 3 Progress (2025-07-19)

  - Treasury: `CfSafnmD6aFHHsT5CtFVQ87YQzBMxCvvGjJtv8hH9GfP` (UNKNOWN - needs update)
  - Reward Token: SOL
  - Launch Timestamp: 0 (not set)

## Critical Wallet Architecture Issue (2025-07-19)

### Problem Discovered
Both Vault and Smart Dial were initialized with incorrect wallet configurations:

**Vault Misconfigurations**:
- `treasury`: Set to deployer (WRONG - should be separate treasury wallet)
- `ownerWallet`: Set to deployer (WRONG - should be separate owner wallet)
- `keeperAuthority`: Set to deployer (WRONG - should be keeper bot wallet)

**Smart Dial Misconfiguration**:
- `treasury`: Set to unknown wallet `CfSafnmD6aFHHsT5CtFVQ87YQzBMxCvvGjJtv8hH9GfP`

### Correct Wallet Architecture
Created proper wallet structure (2025-07-19 12:06 UTC):

| Wallet Type | Public Key | Purpose |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| Authority | `AnCL6TWEGYo3zVhrXckfFiAqdQpo158JUCWPFQJEpS95` | Overall management (deployer) |
| Owner | `5ave8hWx7ZqJr6yrzA2f3DwBa6APRDMYzuLZSU8FKv9D` | Receives 20% of tax |
| Treasury | `Ei9vqjqic5S4cdTyDu98ENc933ub4HJMgAXJ6amnDFCH` | Holds 80% for distribution |
| Keeper | `5E8kjrFSVugkU9tv378uEYQ78DNp9z2MLY2fjSU5E3Ju` | Bot operations |

**Recovery Document**: `/shared-artifacts/MIKO_WALLET_RECOVERY.json` contains all private keys

### Required Corrections
1. **Vault update_config**:
   - Change treasury to `Ei9vqjqic5S4cdTyDu98ENc933ub4HJMgAXJ6amnDFCH`
   - Change ownerWallet to `5ave8hWx7ZqJr6yrzA2f3DwBa6APRDMYzuLZSU8FKv9D`
   - Note: keeperAuthority CANNOT be changed (permanent architectural flaw)

2. **Smart Dial update_treasury**:
   - Change treasury to `5ave8hWx7ZqJr6yrzA2f3DwBa6APRDMYzuLZSU8FKv9D` (must match Vault ownerWallet)

### Configuration Updates Completed (2025-07-19 12:15 UTC)
1. ‚úÖ Vault configuration updated:
   - Treasury: `Ei9vqjqic5S4cdTyDu98ENc933ub4HJMgAXJ6amnDFCH` (correct treasury wallet)
   - Owner Wallet: `5ave8hWx7ZqJr6yrzA2f3DwBa6APRDMYzuLZSU8FKv9D` (correct owner wallet)
   - Keeper Authority: Still deployer (CANNOT be changed - architectural limitation)
   - Update Tx: `2tXHBmda1sbrJDjEbzfEFh3RNSspmVsdYVM26NcQ1wJciDyiaxRWKmHMeHGYaMbhjGZRUrqBtwkc2QoMPhJecZcx`

2. ‚úÖ Smart Dial treasury updated:
   - Treasury: `5ave8hWx7ZqJr6yrzA2f3DwBa6APRDMYzuLZSU8FKv9D` (matches Vault ownerWallet)

  - 90% (900M MIKO) for liquidity pool
  - 10% (100M MIKO) retained by deployer
  - 0% team allocation (none)
  - 0% marketing allocation (none)
- No distributions needed - all tokens remain with deployer
- Ready for launch with full allocation in deployer wallet

### Phase 3 Testing Completed (2025-07-19 13:30 UTC)
‚úÖ All Phase 3 tests passed:
- 30% transfer fee is active and working
- Withheld fees accumulate correctly
- Vault PDA has harvest authority

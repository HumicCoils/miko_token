# MIKO Token Development Status

## Current Phase: Phase 2 - Absolute Vault Program

### Completed Tasks âœ…

#### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (COMPLETED)

#### Environment Setup
1. **Rust Installation** - rustc 1.87.0 installed successfully
2. **Solana CLI** - solana-cli 2.2.16 installed and verified
3. **Anchor Framework** - Version 0.30.1 installed via AVM
4. **Local Validator** - solana-test-validator ready for use
5. **Directory Structure** - All required directories created:
   ```
   miko-token/
   â”œâ”€â”€ programs/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ absolute-vault/
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ smart-dial/
   â”œâ”€â”€ keeper-bot/
   â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
   â””â”€â”€ scripts/
   ```

#### Project Initialization
1. **Anchor Workspace** - Configured with:
   - Anchor.toml with Token-2022 support
   - package.json for main project
   - tsconfig.json for TypeScript support
   - .prettierignore for code formatting
   
2. **Keeper Bot Setup** - TypeScript project initialized with:
   - Dedicated package.json with all required dependencies
   - tsconfig.json configured for ES2020 target
   - All npm packages installed including:
     - @coral-xyz/anchor
     - @solana/web3.js
     - @solana/spl-token
     - node-cron, axios, dotenv
     - winston for logging
     - Development tools (TypeScript, ESLint, Jest)

#### Token Creation (COMPLETED)
1. **MIKO Token deployed on devnet**
   - Mint: H5KVrB48CTUVsQhYRULzEEZ5LCLxjJWCX7dHeLW4FVEw
   - 5% transfer fee implemented and verified
   - Transfer fee config authority REVOKED (permanently fixed at 5%)
   - Successfully tested transfers with fee collection

#### Phase 2: Absolute Vault Program (IN PROGRESS)

**Completed:**
1. **Program Structure Created**
   - Cargo.toml configured with proper dependencies
   - lib.rs with program declaration and instruction handlers
   - Full directory structure established

2. **State Structures Implemented**
   - VaultState struct with all required fields
   - ExclusionEntry struct with fee/reward exclusion types
   - HolderData struct for distribution data
   - Constants defined (fee splits, limits, PDA seeds)
   - Comprehensive error codes enum

3. **Program Foundation Ready**
   - PDA seed constants defined
   - System account detection logic
   - Exclusion type management

#### Instructions Implementation (COMPLETED)
All seven core instructions have been implemented:
1. âœ… `initialize` - Sets up vault with initial configuration
2. âœ… `harvest_fees` - Collects withheld fees from token accounts
3. âœ… `distribute_rewards` - Sends rewards to eligible holders
4. âœ… `manage_exclusions` - Add/remove wallet exclusions
5. âœ… `update_config` - Update vault configuration
6. âœ… `emergency_withdraw_vault` - Emergency fund withdrawal
7. âœ… `emergency_withdraw_withheld` - Recover stuck fees

Additional helper instructions added:
- `initialize_system_exclusions` - Auto-exclude system accounts
- `update_authority` - Transfer program authority
- `check_exclusion` - Query exclusion status
- `emergency_withdraw_all` - Withdraw all funds
- `harvest_withheld_to_mint` - Harvest without withdrawing

### Current Issues ðŸš§

#### Compilation Errors
The Absolute Vault program has several compilation errors that need resolution:

1. **Import/Type Issues**:
   - Missing imports for some instruction contexts in lib.rs
   - Lifetime parameter issues in distribute_rewards handler
   - Context type resolution problems

2. **Token-2022 Integration**:
   - The harvest_fees instruction needs proper Token-2022 CPI implementation
   - Currently returns 0 as placeholder - requires withdraw withheld authority setup

3. **Technical Blockers**:
   - Need to properly implement Token-2022 harvest/withdraw withheld tokens CPIs
   - Lifetime issues in distribute_rewards when accessing remaining_accounts
   - Context type compatibility between instruction handlers

### Next Steps ðŸ“‹

#### Fix Compilation Issues
- [ ] Resolve import and type issues in lib.rs
- [ ] Fix lifetime parameters in distribute_rewards
- [ ] Implement proper Token-2022 harvest CPI
- [ ] Test program compilation

#### Continue to Phase 3: Smart Dial Program
Once Absolute Vault compiles:
- [ ] Create Smart Dial program structure
- [ ] Implement reward token configuration
- [ ] Add update mechanisms
- [ ] Test integration with Absolute Vault

### Technical Environment Summary

| Component | Version | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Rust | 1.87.0 | âœ… Installed |
| Solana CLI | 2.2.16 | âœ… Installed |
| Anchor | 0.30.1 | âœ… Installed |
| Node.js | System default | âœ… Available |
| TypeScript | 5.5.4 | âœ… Installed (keeper-bot) |

### Repository State
- All previous implementation files have been removed
- Clean workspace ready for fresh implementation
- Documentation files (README.md, PLAN.md, TO_DO.md) preserved
- Foundation setup complete and ready for token creation

### Recommendations
1. Begin with Token-2022 deployment script in the scripts directory
2. Set up a local test validator for development
3. Create test wallets for development purposes
4. Start implementing the Absolute Vault program structure

The project is now ready to proceed with the token creation phase as outlined in the TO_DO.md checklist.

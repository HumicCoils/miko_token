- ✅ Mint authority: Still with deployer (will be revoked in Phase 3)
- ✅ All fee/hook authorities: Temporarily with deployer
- ✅ Future Vault PDA calculated: `FKXCuPR6EyX4hrc413oti7ZMKEgqG1ekKVvqLNhjNxWg`
- 💰 Token creation cost: ~0.003 SOL

**Phase 2 Validation:**
- ✅ Token info saved to shared-artifacts/token-info.json
- ✅ Verification script confirms all Phase 2 requirements met
- ⚠️ Transfer testing shows hook requires initialization (expected - Phase 3 task)
- ✅ Previous failed token (FPPGUYf6Ktir6z5VVu4cfbQaBmLawXq6y214fXfHxRJm) no longer referenced

## Next Steps 📋

**Phase 2 Complete! ✅** MIKO token has been created with 1B supply and temporary authorities.

According to TO_DO.md, the next phase is:

### Phase 3: System Initialization & Authority Transfer

1. **Container Setup**
   - Create initialization environment 
   - Access program IDs and token info from shared-artifacts

2. **Calculate PDAs**
   - Calculate Vault PDA using mint address and 'vault' seed
   - Save PDA addresses for use in transfers

3. **Vault Initialization**
   - Create initialization script
   - Initialize vault to create the PDA
   - Set treasury, owner, keeper wallets
   - Set minimum hold amount and harvest threshold
   - Verify auto-exclusions applied

4. **Authority Transfers**
   - Transfer fee config authority from deployer to Vault PDA
   - Transfer withdraw withheld authority from deployer to Vault PDA
   - Transfer hook authority from deployer to Vault PDA
   - Revoke mint authority permanently

5. **Transfer Hook Initialization**
   - Initialize with token mint and total supply
   - Set launch configuration
   - Must be done BEFORE any token transfers

6. **Token Distribution**
   - Send tokens from deployer to appropriate wallets
   - Ensure all allocations complete before launch

## Phase 3 Blocker 🚨

### Critical Issue: Cannot Initialize Programs Without IDL

**Date: 2025-07-15**

**Issue Description:**
Phase 3 requires initializing the Vault, Transfer Hook, and Smart Dial programs. This initialization process requires either:
1. IDL (Interface Definition Language) files generated from the Anchor programs
2. Manual construction of initialization instructions

**Current Status:**
- ❌ IDL generation fails with compilation error in anchor-syn v0.30.1
- ❌ Cannot proceed with program initialization without IDL
- ✅ Token authorities can be transferred, but without initialized programs, the system is non-functional

**Technical Details:**
```
error[E0599]: no method named `source_file` found for struct `proc_macro2::Span`
--> anchor-syn-0.30.1/src/idl/defined.rs:499:66
```

This appears to be a version compatibility issue between proc_macro2 and anchor-syn.

**Impact:**
Without proper program initialization:
- The Vault PDA won't actually exist (it's created during initialization)
- Transfer Hook won't enforce the 1% anti-sniper limit
- Smart Dial won't be configured for reward token management
- The entire system would be broken despite having correct authorities

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. ❌ Running `anchor idl build` from Phase 1 container - compilation error
2. ❌ Accessing pre-built IDL files - they were never generated
3. ❌ Creating "simplified" initialization - rejected as it violates development principles

**Next Steps Required:**
1. Fix the anchor-syn compilation issue in Phase 1 to generate IDLs
2. OR implement manual instruction construction for initialization
3. OR upgrade/downgrade Anchor version to resolve compatibility

**This is a blocking issue that prevents achieving full functionality as required by the development principles.**

## Risk Assessment
**High Risk**: Phase 3 blocked due to IDL generation failure. Cannot proceed with proper system initialization without resolving this technical issue.

## Lessons Learned
1. Always check GLIBC requirements when using Solana in Docker
2. Use Ubuntu 22.04 or newer for Solana development containers
3. The --locked flag in cargo install can cause version conflicts
4. Solana installation URL changed from release.solana.com to release.anza.xyz
5. Platform specification (linux/amd64) is important for cross-platform Docker builds
6. CRITICAL: Never set a PDA as authority before it exists - PDAs must be initialized first
7. Always mint total token supply before revoking mint authority
8. Transfer hooks require initialization before transfers can occur

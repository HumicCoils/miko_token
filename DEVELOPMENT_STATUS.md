# MIKO Token Development Status

## Current Phase: Phase 2 - Absolute Vault Program

## Status: BLOCKED

### Critical Issue: Token-2022 Fee Harvesting Integration

The Absolute Vault Program cannot compile due to incompatibility between Anchor 0.30.1 and SPL Token-2022's fee harvesting mechanisms.

### Specific Compilation Errors

1. **Missing Token-2022 CPI Functions in Anchor**:
   - `HarvestWithheldTokensToMint` struct not found
   - `harvest_withheld_tokens_to_mint` function not found
   - `WithdrawWithheldTokensFromAccounts` struct not found
   - `withdraw_withheld_tokens_from_accounts` function not found

2. **Type Compatibility Issues**:
   - `TokenAccount` and `Mint` from `anchor_spl::token_interface` don't implement required traits
   - Need to use `InterfaceAccount` wrapper but still have trait bound issues

### Impact on Core Functionality

These functions are CRITICAL for the MIKO token's tax mechanism:
- **harvest_fees instruction**: Cannot collect the 5% transfer fees from token accounts
- **emergency_withdraw_withheld instruction**: Cannot recover stuck fees

Without these working, the entire tax collection and distribution system fails.

### Development Status

#### Completed:
- ✓ Phase 2 Docker container set up with Solana 1.18.23, Anchor 0.30.1
- ✓ Basic SPL Token-2022 integration confirmed (token_2022 feature works)
- ✓ Created vault state structures with multi-token support
- ✓ Created instruction files (but they don't compile)

#### Blocked:
- ✗ Instructions do not compile due to Token-2022 CPI issues
- ✗ Cannot proceed with PDA verification
- ✗ Cannot build or deploy the program
- ✗ Cannot test any functionality

### Root Cause Analysis

Anchor 0.30.1's `anchor-spl` crate does not expose the Token-2022 extension instructions needed for fee harvesting. The functions exist in the underlying `spl-token-2022` crate but are not wrapped by Anchor.

### Attempted Solutions
1. Used `anchor_spl::token_2022` - functions don't exist
2. Tried importing `spl_token_2022::instruction` directly - still integration issues
3. Changed types to `InterfaceAccount` - doesn't resolve all issues

### Options Forward

1. **Research Alternative Integration**: Find the correct way to call Token-2022 fee functions from Anchor
2. **Direct CPI Without Anchor Wrapper**: Use raw Solana CPI to call Token-2022 instructions
3. **Update Dependencies**: Try newer versions of Anchor that might have better Token-2022 support

### Principles Maintained
- Not simplifying or removing fee functionality
- Not proceeding without working instructions
- Documenting exact technical blockers
- Maintaining requirement for full PRD-level functionality

## Recommendation

This is a fundamental compatibility issue that requires research into proper Token-2022 fee harvesting integration with Anchor. Cannot proceed with Phase 2 until this is resolved.

- 💰 Deployment cost: ~1.75 SOL

### Phase 2 Completed ✅

**Critical Design Flaw Discovered and Fixed:**
- ❌ Initial attempt: Tried to set Vault PDA as authorities before it existed
- ❌ Result: Token created with wrong authorities and no supply minted
- ✅ Solution: Updated architecture to use deployer as temporary authorities
- ✅ Documents updated: README.md, PLAN.md, TO_DO.md revised with correct approach

**MIKO Token Created Successfully:**
- ✅ Token mint: `9tBdY18t35LMGqzNbzbqNyKYm7b4cmWx6AzYvSKR9BuG`
- ✅ Total supply: 1,000,000,000 MIKO (minted successfully)
- ✅ Decimals: 9
- ✅ All tokens in deployer wallet: `AxbjsdedZ3VUgQacyqHGKFDH3VK3nehHZGjA5NHwcBGs`
- ✅ Transfer fee: 30% (3000 basis points) active
- ✅ Transfer hook: Enabled and linked to program
- ✅ Freeze authority: null (permanent - tokens can never be frozen)
- ✅ Mint authority: Still with deployer (will be revoked in Phase 3)
- ✅ All fee/hook authorities: Temporarily with deployer
- ✅ Future Vault PDA calculated: `FKXCuPR6EyX4hrc413oti7ZMKEgqG1ekKVvqLNhjNxWg`
- 💰 Token creation cost: ~0.003 SOL

**Phase 2 Validation:**
- ✅ Token info saved to shared-artifacts/token-info.json
- ✅ Verification script confirms all Phase 2 requirements met
- ⚠️ Transfer testing shows hook requires initialization (expected - Phase 3 task)
- ✅ Previous failed token (FPPGUYf6Ktir6z5VVu4cfbQaBmLawXq6y214fXfHxRJm) no longer referenced

### Phase 3 Progress (PARTIAL) ⚠️

**Successfully Completed:**
- ✅ Created Phase 3 Docker container with initialization environment
- ✅ Calculated Vault PDA correctly: `FKXCuPR6EyX4hrc413oti7ZMKEgqG1ekKVvqLNhjNxWg`
- ✅ Resolved IDL generation blocker with manual instruction construction
- ✅ Fixed borsh v0.7.0 serialization (Map-based schema required)
- ✅ Vault program initialized (was already initialized, skipped)
- ✅ All authorities transferred to Vault PDA:
  - ✅ Transfer fee config authority
  - ✅ Withdraw withheld authority  
  - ✅ Transfer hook authority
- ✅ Mint authority permanently revoked (set to null)
- ✅ System wallets configured (treasury, owner, keeper)

**Blocked by Program ID Mismatch:**
- ❌ Transfer Hook initialization - declared vs deployed ID mismatch
- ❌ Smart Dial initialization - declared vs deployed ID mismatch
- ❌ 30% transfer fee testing - requires initialized Transfer Hook
- ❌ Token distribution - unsafe without initialized Transfer Hook

## Next Steps 📋

**Phase 3 Partially Complete! ⚠️** Vault initialized and authorities transferred, but blocked by program ID mismatches.

### Critical Actions Required:

1. **Fix Program ID Mismatches**
   - Option A: Redeploy Transfer Hook and Smart Dial with correct declared IDs
   - Option B: Modify source code to use deployed IDs and rebuild
   - Option C: Deploy new versions with matching IDs

2. **Complete Phase 3 After Fix**
   - Initialize Transfer Hook with correct program ID
   - Initialize Smart Dial with correct program ID
   - Test 30% transfer fee collection
   - Distribute tokens from deployer wallet

3. **Current Workaround (NOT RECOMMENDED)**
   - System is partially functional with basic 30% fee
   - But lacks anti-sniper protection and proper fee enforcement
   - Not production-ready without Transfer Hook initialization

## Phase 3 Blockers 🚨

### Critical Issue 1: IDL Generation Failed (RESOLVED with manual construction)

**Date: 2025-07-15**

**Issue Description:**
IDL generation failed with anchor-syn v0.30.1 compilation error.

**Resolution:**
✅ Implemented manual instruction construction using borsh v0.7.0 serialization

### Critical Issue 2: Program ID Mismatch Prevents Initialization

**Date: 2025-07-15**

**Issue Description:**
Transfer Hook and Smart Dial programs have mismatched program IDs between declared (in source code) and deployed addresses. This prevents proper PDA derivation and initialization.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Vault program initialized successfully (no ID mismatch)
- ✅ All authorities transferred to Vault PDA
- ✅ Mint authority revoked permanently
- ❌ Transfer Hook initialization blocked - PDA mismatch
- ❌ Smart Dial initialization blocked - PDA mismatch
- ❌ Cannot test 30% transfer fee without initialized Transfer Hook
- ❌ Cannot distribute tokens safely without initialized Transfer Hook

**Technical Details:**
```
Transfer Hook:
- Declared ID (in lib.rs): 2Mh6sSYeqeyqRZz8cr7y8gFtxyNf7HoMWqwzm9uTFav3
- Deployed ID (actual): B2KkZbyd9jptD4ns1mBCCrLXH9ozbTWGN4PwgKfAg3LP
- Hook Config PDA with declared: 34uaZAqB2GiiEWbUSfhe4JHtSeLbXRNADL9azXskQvr7
- Hook Config PDA with deployed: XgcynkLfUM86fkG4gY4y8y9gVnWpcKjiBHy8zQt2C7v

Smart Dial:
- Declared ID (in lib.rs): 2Ymuq9Nt9s1GH1qGVuFd6jCqefJcmsPReE3MmiieEhZc
- Deployed ID (actual): F73eRCVZv9mxaMjYUd3Le3gPeEMQgFHU8qL3v3YmrHjg
```

**Root Cause:**
Programs were compiled with one program ID (declare_id! macro) but deployed with different IDs. The program code uses the declared ID for PDA derivation, making the deployed programs unable to find their PDAs.

**Impact:**
- Transfer Hook cannot be initialized → 30% fee won't be properly enforced
- Smart Dial cannot be initialized → AI reward selection unavailable
- Token transfers may fail or behave unexpectedly
- System is partially functional but not production-ready

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. ✅ Fixed borsh serialization issues (Map-based schema for v0.7.0)
2. ✅ Fixed PDA seed strings (hook-config, smart-dial)
3. ❌ Cannot fix program ID mismatch without redeployment

**Required Fix:**
Programs must be redeployed with correct declared IDs matching deployment, OR recompiled with deployed IDs as declared IDs.

## Risk Assessment
**High Risk**: Phase 3 partially blocked due to program ID mismatch. Transfer Hook and Smart Dial cannot be initialized, preventing:
- Anti-sniper protection (1% transaction limit)
- Proper fee enforcement beyond the basic 30%
- AI-driven reward token selection
- Safe token distribution (without initialized Transfer Hook)

**Partial Success**: 
- Vault initialized successfully
- All authorities transferred to Vault PDA
- Mint authority permanently revoked
- System is partially functional but not production-ready

## Lessons Learned
1. Always check GLIBC requirements when using Solana in Docker
2. Use Ubuntu 22.04 or newer for Solana development containers
3. The --locked flag in cargo install can cause version conflicts
4. Solana installation URL changed from release.solana.com to release.anza.xyz
5. Platform specification (linux/amd64) is important for cross-platform Docker builds
6. CRITICAL: Never set a PDA as authority before it exists - PDAs must be initialized first
7. Always mint total token supply before revoking mint authority
8. Transfer hooks require initialization before transfers can occur
9. CRITICAL: Always ensure declare_id! in program source matches the actual deployment ID
10. Manual instruction construction with borsh requires Map-based schema for v0.7.0

### Current Blocker - Vault Initialization

The Absolute Vault program has been successfully deployed (Program ID: DHzZjjPoRmbYvTsXE3Je1JW2M4qgkKsqsuTz3uKHh4qJ), but we are encountering a critical issue with initialization:

**Issue**: Cannot properly initialize the vault due to Anchor IDL and instruction serialization problems
- Error: "InstructionDidNotDeserialize" when calling the initialize instruction
- The program expects Anchor-specific serialization format but IDL generation is failing
- Attempted workarounds with manual IDL creation result in version compatibility issues

**Root Cause**: 
- The program was built with Anchor 0.30.1 which has known issues with IDL generation
- The `idl-build` feature compilation fails due to dependencies
- Without proper IDL, we cannot correctly serialize instruction data for the program

**This is a fundamental blocker** that prevents:
1. Vault initialization with proper configuration
2. Testing of fee harvesting functionality
3. Testing of reward distribution
4. Any further development that depends on the vault being operational

**Potential Solutions to Explore**:
1. Fix the IDL build issue by resolving the anchor-syn dependency problem
2. Downgrade to a different Anchor version that has better IDL support
3. Build a custom client that properly serializes Anchor instructions without relying on IDL
4. Investigate alternative ways to generate the IDL file

**Note**: We must solve this properly rather than using workarounds, as the vault initialization is critical for the entire system to function.

### What Remains (Blocked by Initialization)

1. **Immediate Requirements**:
   - Successfully initialize the vault program
   - Test fee harvesting from token accounts
   - Verify reward distribution mechanism
   - Create integration tests

2. **Phase 3: Smart Dial Program**:
   - Implement the AI-driven reward percentage adjustment
   - Oracle price feed integration
   - 0-3% dynamic reward range implementation

3. **Phase 4: Keeper Bot**:
   - Automated fee harvesting service
   - Reward distribution automation
   - AI monitoring service for Smart Dial updates

### Important Note

All functionality described in README.md and PLAN.md has been preserved. No features were simplified or removed to expedite development. The system maintains:
- Complete fee harvesting mechanism with SPL Token-2022
- Full reward distribution system
- Comprehensive exclusion list management
- All emergency functions
- System account auto-exclusion

The project is on track to achieve the full PRD-level functionality as specified.

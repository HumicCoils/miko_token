## Recommendations

1. **For Production**:
   - Update Anchor to latest version (0.30.x) for better spl-token-2022 support
   - Fix import errors by properly exporting context structs from instruction modules
   - Consider using older spl-token instead of spl-token-2022 if compatibility issues persist
   - Add proper trait implementations for custom instruction contexts

2. **For Mainnet**:
   - Do not deploy until all compilation issues are resolved
   - Conduct thorough audit after fixing build issues
   - Test with smaller stack variables to avoid overflow
   - Consider breaking up large functions into smaller components

## Sign-off

- ☐ All tests passed
- ☐ Ready for next phase
- ☑ Issues need resolution

**Tester Signature**: Automated Test System  
**Date**: 2025-06-29

## Critical Failure Summary

The test suite could not be executed due to fundamental build failures in the Anchor programs. The primary issues are:

1. **SPL Token 2022 Compatibility**: The current version has stack overflow issues in the confidential transfer proof functions
2. **Missing Type Exports**: The program is trying to use types (AddExclusion, RemoveExclusion) that aren't properly exported from the instructions module
3. **Anchor Context Issues**: Several instruction contexts don't satisfy the required trait bounds

These issues must be resolved before any testing can proceed on devnet or mainnet.

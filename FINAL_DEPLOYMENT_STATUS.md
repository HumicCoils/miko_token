# MIKO Token Final Deployment Status

## Summary

Development and testing are **NOT COMPLETE** due to deployment issues.

### What's Done:
1. ✅ **Source code updated** with new tax distribution logic (3 scenarios)
2. ✅ **Keeper bot code updated** to handle all scenarios  
3. ✅ **Programs compiled** successfully

### What's NOT Done:
1. ❌ **Updated programs NOT deployed** - The deployed programs still have OLD logic
   - Absolute Vault at `8WxswFv712scfX5ef9BVDva18DnkfsTTUQjBCk2yW4yd` has OLD code (wrong declare_id!)
   - Smart Dial at `C4S6VBsqxWsVieMfR2RcJNyFUnUUnuFDkg5g7km7rU23` has OLD code (wrong declare_id!)
2. ❌ **Programs NOT initialized** - Cannot initialize due to ID mismatch
3. ❌ **Integration testing NOT possible** - Cannot test without properly deployed programs

### The Problem:
- The programs were deployed BEFORE updating the `declare_id!` in the source code
- Now the deployed programs have a hardcoded ID that doesn't match their actual address
- This causes `DeclaredProgramIdMismatch` error when trying to initialize

### Solutions:
1. **Deploy fresh programs** with new keypairs after fixing declare_id
2. **Use a localnet** for testing instead of devnet
3. **Fix the deployment process** to ensure declare_id matches before deployment

### SOL Status:
- Recovered ~10 SOL from old programs and failed buffers
- Current balance: ~5.5 SOL available for deployment
- Multiple deployment attempts failed due to RPC issues

## Conclusion

**Testing cannot proceed** with the current deployment. The programs need to be properly deployed with matching declare_id values before any testing can be done.

The development is technically complete (code is written) but deployment and testing are blocked.

# MIKO Token Project Status Report

## Project Overview
MIKO Token is a Solana blockchain project implementing a tax and reward distribution system using the Token-2022 standard. The project consists of three main components:
1. **Absolute Vault Program** - Manages 5% tax collection and distribution
2. **Smart Dial Program** - Dynamically updates reward tokens based on AI agent tweets
3. **Keeper Bot** - TypeScript service that monitors AI agent and orchestrates distributions

## Development Process Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Setup ✅
1. Initialized Anchor workspace with `anchor init`
2. Created project structure for both programs
3. Set up TypeScript configuration for keeper bot

### Phase 2: Smart Contract Development ✅
1. **Absolute Vault Program**
   - Implemented 5% tax mechanism (immutable)
   - Created holder registry with chunked storage
   - Built tax distribution logic (1% owner, 4% holders)
   
2. **Smart Dial Program**
   - Implemented reward token update mechanism
   - Created keeper bot authorization
   - Built wallet update functionality

### Phase 3: Build Configuration Issues ✅
1. **Anchor Version Mismatch**
   - CLI: 0.31.1
   - Project: 0.29.0
   - Solution: Added `[toolchain]` section to Anchor.toml

2. **Token-2022 Import Issues**
   - anchor-spl 0.29.0 doesn't have token-2022 feature
   - Solution: Used standard token features with UncheckedAccount for Token-2022

3. **Build Command Issues**
   - `anchor build` failed with "no such command: build-bpf"
   - Solution: Used `cargo build-sbf` directly

### Phase 4: Deployment Phase 🔄 (CURRENT)
1. **Absolute Vault**: ✅ Successfully deployed
   - Program ID: `838Ra5u255By2HkV7mtzP6KFgXnjrQiQDB3Gmdpbrf2d`
   - Deployed to devnet
   
2. **Smart Dial**: ❌ Deployment blocked
   - Multiple deployment attempts failed
   - Serious issue discovered with deployment process

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- All smart contract code implemented
- Programs successfully compiled with `cargo build-sbf`
- Absolute Vault program deployed to devnet
- Keeper bot implementation complete
- Test and production documentation created

### 🔄 In Progress
- Smart Dial program deployment to devnet

### ⏳ Pending
- Program initialization
- Token creation with 5% tax
- Keeper bot deployment
- Integration testing on devnet

## Critical Issue: Deployment Transaction Flood

### Problem Description
The `solana program deploy` command is sending hundreds of parallel write transactions, causing:
- Rapid SOL consumption (lost ~10 SOL in seconds)
- Transaction failures due to network congestion
- Multiple failed buffer accounts created

### Root Cause
The Solana CLI (v2.2.16) uses an aggressive parallel transaction strategy for program deployment that:
1. Splits the program binary into chunks
2. Sends all chunks as parallel transactions
3. Does not properly throttle or limit concurrent transactions
4. Results in hundreds of simultaneous network requests

### Failed Attempts
1. Direct deployment: `solana program deploy`
2. Deployment with scripts: Multiple custom scripts
3. Anchor deployment: `anchor deploy`
4. Buffer-based deployment: Writing buffer separately
5. Various flags: `--max-sign-attempts`, custom RPC endpoints

### Evidence
- Transaction history shows 200+ simultaneous transactions
- Each failed deployment creates a buffer account consuming ~1.6 SOL
- Error messages consistently show "XXX write transactions failed"

### Recovered Resources
Successfully recovered SOL from failed buffer accounts:
- Closed 6 buffer accounts
- Recovered approximately 8+ SOL

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Find Alternative Deployment Method**
   - Research deployment tools that properly throttle transactions
   - Consider using Solana Playground or other web-based tools
   - Look into programmatic deployment with controlled transaction flow

2. **Smart Dial Deployment**
   - Program keypair ready: `67sZQtNqoRs5RjncYXMaeRAGrgUK49GSaLJCvHA2SXrj`
   - Binary ready at: `target/deploy/smart_dial.so`
   - Need safe deployment method

### Subsequent Steps (After Deployment)
1. Initialize both programs with test parameters
2. Create MIKO token with 5% transfer fee
3. Deploy and test keeper bot
4. Run integration tests on devnet
5. Document any additional issues

## Recommendations

1. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Do NOT use standard `solana program deploy` until issue is resolved
   - Consider alternative deployment methods
   - Always check buffer accounts after failed deployments

2. **Resource Management**
   - Keep track of all buffer accounts
   - Regularly clean up failed deployments
   - Monitor SOL balance during deployments

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update deployment guides with warnings about this issue
   - Provide alternative deployment methods
   - Include buffer cleanup procedures

## Environment Details
- Network: Devnet
- Solana CLI: 2.2.16
- Anchor CLI: 0.31.1
- Anchor Framework: 0.29.0
- Current Wallet: `/home/humiccoils/.config/solana/deployer-test.json`
- Current Balance: ~8 SOL (after recovery)

# Technical Brief: Resolving the MIKO Token Testing Impasse

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the critical blocker currently halting Phase 2 testing of the MIKO token's `Absolute Vault` program and presents a strategic solution to resolve it. The core issue is the **unavailability of MIKO tokens on the devnet** for testing, a direct consequence of the intentional and permanent revocation of the token's mint authority—a key security feature.

The proposed solution is to **deploy a separate, functionally identical MIKO "Dev-Token"** with the sole difference of having a non-revoked mint authority. This approach will unblock all testing activities without compromising the integrity or simplifying the functionality of the final production code, ensuring full adherence to the project's PRD requirements.

## 2. Current Development Impasse

The project is blocked at the testing stage for the `Absolute Vault` program, as detailed in `DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md` and the `TO_DO.md` checklist.

### 2.1. Root Cause: Lack of Testable Tokens

The fundamental problem is that the `Absolute Vault`'s core mechanics—fee harvesting and reward distribution—cannot be tested without MIKO token transfers. The mint authority for the official MIKO devnet token (`H5KVrB48CTUVsQhYRULzEEZ5LCLxjJWCX7dHeLW4FVEw`) was permanently revoked to enforce the immutable 5% transfer fee, as specified in the project's core design. While this is a crucial feature for mainnet security, it prevents the development team from minting new tokens required for testing scenarios.

### 2.2. Blocked Functionality

Due to the inability to generate token transfers and accumulate fees, the following critical `Absolute Vault` instructions cannot be validated:

* **`harvest_fees`**: No withheld fees exist to be collected.
* **`distribute_rewards`**: No harvested fees are available to be swapped and distributed as rewards.
* **`emergency_withdraw_vault`**: The vault cannot accumulate funds to test withdrawals.
* **`emergency_withdraw_withheld`**: Cannot test the recovery of stuck fees without generating them first.

This directly impedes progress on the tasks outlined in the "Program Testing" section of `TO_DO.md`.

## 3. Proposed Solution: The MIKO Dev-Token Strategy

To resolve this impasse without modifying or simplifying the core program logic, we will introduce a dedicated **MIKO Dev-Token** for use within the devnet environment only.

### 3.1. Guiding Principle

This strategy strictly adheres to the core requirement: **"Do not attempt to 'simplify' the functionality to temporarily solve or bypass the problem."** The `Absolute Vault` program code will remain unchanged. The solution isolates the problem to the test environment itself and resolves it by providing the necessary test assets.

### 3.2. The Dev-Token Specifications

A new SPL Token will be deployed to the devnet with the following characteristics:

* **Standard**: Token-2022
* **Transfer Fee**: 5% (500 basis points), identical to the production MIKO token.
* **Mint Authority**: **RETAINED** (Not Revoked). This is the only difference from the production token.

This Dev-Token will allow the team to mint and distribute tokens freely to various test wallets, simulating a live ecosystem and generating the transaction fees needed for comprehensive testing.

### 3.3. Benefits of This Approach

* **Unblocks All Testing**: Enables full end-to-end validation of the entire fee harvest, swap, and reward distribution lifecycle.
* **Ensures Full Functionality**: Guarantees that the `Absolute Vault` program works exactly as designed, satisfying all PRD-level requirements.
* **Maintains Development Velocity**: Allows the team to complete all Phase 2 checklist items and confidently proceed to Phase 3 (`Smart Dial` program development).
* **No Code Simplification**: The production-ready code remains robust and uncompromised.

## 4. Actionable Implementation Plan

The following steps should be executed to implement this solution:

#### Step 1: Create Dev-Token Deployment Script

1.  Duplicate the existing `scripts/create-miko-token.ts` file to a new file, such as `scripts/create-miko-dev-token.ts`.
2.  In the new script, **comment out or remove** the section that revokes the mint/transfer fee authority (`createSetAuthorityInstruction`). This is the critical change.

#### Step 2: Deploy the New Dev-Token

1.  Execute the newly created `create-miko-dev-token.ts` script to deploy the new token to the Solana devnet.
2.  Securely store the mint address of this new Dev-Token.

#### Step 3: Update Test Environment Configuration

1.  Modify all relevant testing files, including `scripts/devnet-test-suite.ts` and any Keeper Bot configurations, to use the **new Dev-Token mint address**.
2.  Initialize a new instance of the `Absolute Vault` program that is configured to interact with the new Dev-Token.

#### Step 4: Execute Full Test Suite

1.  Use the retained mint authority to issue Dev-Tokens to a variety of test wallets.
2.  Execute the comprehensive tests in `devnet-test-suite.ts`, ensuring all previously blocked scenarios are now covered:
    * Confirm fee generation on transfers.
    * Verify successful fee harvesting and splitting (1% owner / 4% treasury).
    * Validate the reward distribution mechanism.
    * Test all emergency withdrawal functions.
    * Confirm exclusion list management works as expected.

## 5. Conclusion

This Dev-Token strategy is a standard and professional software development practice that resolves the current testing blocker effectively. It enables rigorous validation of the `Absolute Vault` program's complete functionality while upholding the project's core principles of security and immutability for the final, production-level MIKO token.

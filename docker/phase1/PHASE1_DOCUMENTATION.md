# Phase 1: Foundation and Token Creation - Documentation

## Overview

Phase 1 successfully created the MIKO token on Solana devnet with a permanent 5% transfer fee using Token-2022 extensions.

## Working Version Combination

The following stable version combination was used:

- **Base OS**: Ubuntu 22.04
- **Node.js**: v20.19.3
- **Rust**: 1.88.0
- **Solana CLI**: 1.18.0
- **Anchor**: 0.30.1
- **TypeScript**: 5.8.3
- **@solana/web3.js**: 1.98.2
- **@solana/spl-token**: 0.4.13

## Deployed Token Information

```json
{
  "mint": "GrPe8ph2F4LDWjx9ocjSENrL9kVygZuQf9iDzHc61GDv",
  "decimals": 9,
  "transferFeeBasisPoints": 500,
  "transferFeePercentage": "5%",
  "authority": "2JQFnYmaTAZX5b16UfuBDRSg3i5TuT22MsjHiNZwZpEm",
  "createdAt": "2025-07-09T14:31:16.780Z",
  "network": "devnet"
}
```

## Key Achievements

1. **Token Creation**: Successfully deployed MIKO token with Token-2022 extensions
2. **Transfer Fee**: Implemented 5% transfer fee (500 basis points)
3. **Authority Revocation**: Transfer fee authority was revoked, making the 5% fee permanent
4. **Verification**: Tested and confirmed that transfers correctly deduct 5% fee

## Docker Container Details

### Dockerfile
- Custom Ubuntu 22.04 base image
- Installed all necessary development tools
- Configured paths for Solana and Anchor CLIs
- Volume mounting for workspace and shared artifacts

### Key Scripts Created

1. **create-miko-token.ts**: Deploys the MIKO token with transfer fee extension
2. **test-transfer-fee.ts**: Verifies the 5% fee mechanism works correctly

## Test Results

Transfer fee test confirmed:
- Transferring 100 MIKO tokens
- Recipient receives 95 MIKO tokens
- 5 MIKO tokens (5%) withheld as fee
- âœ… Fee mechanism working as designed

## Next Steps

Phase 1 is complete. The token infrastructure is ready for Phase 2, where we'll build the Absolute Vault program to harvest and distribute the collected fees.

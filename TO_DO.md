## Phase 2 Testing Summary

❌ **PHASE 2 TESTING IS BLOCKED AND INCOMPLETE**

Despite following guidance in solve_problem.md, critical functionality remains untested:

1. **Dev-Token Strategy**: Created identical token with retained mint authority
2. **Test Execution Results**:
   - ✅ Exclusion management: Tested and working
   - ✅ Fee generation: Confirmed fees are collected
   - ❌ Fee harvesting: NOT TESTED - Vault tied to original token
   - ❌ Reward distribution: NOT TESTED - Depends on harvesting
   - ❌ Emergency withdrawals: NOT TESTED - Requires vault funds

3. **Test Deployment Attempt**: 
   - Deployed test instance but initialization failed
   - Error: DeclaredProgramIdMismatch (hardcoded program ID)
   - Cannot rebuild due to dependency issues

**CRITICAL**: Core functionality (fee harvesting, reward distribution) has NOT been verified. Phase 2 cannot be marked complete without testing these essential features.
